Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis, known as EDA, is the process of analysing and investigating data in order to test hypothesis and check assumptions, to discover patterns and spot any exceptions. This is achieved by using data visualisations methods and summary statistics.

The Titanic is a well known disaster, a luxury ship that sank after coming into contact with an iceberg in 1912. The story has inspired multiple books and the famously known movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. In this notebook I will begin an exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset.
